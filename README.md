## INSPIRATION

The inspiration for LVLS stems from a casual conversation with an affiliated member of the HARMAN company that demonstrated a fundamental absence in visual equalizer functionality. Upon learning there was no such function currently available, it was our sworn duty as avid music listeners and connoisseurs of the ideal audio-visual entertainment experience to provide such functionality to our fellow, music-listening brethren.

## WHAT IT DOES?

The application allows the JBL Pulse 2 speaker to execute proper audio visualization by utilizing the 11x9 LED screen to provide a visual equalizer.

## BUILT WITH?

Love. Determination. Energy Drink Fuel. Power of Collaboration/Friendship.
We also utilized both Android Studio and the JBL Pulse 2 SDK.

## CHALLENGES?

There were a lot of challenges with mapping out the layout of the LED lights in the system. We had to physically draw out a layout and visualize the placement of each LED light that needed to light up. There were issues with adding activities to handle to operations. Lastly, brainstorming a way to properly implement a FFT* was difficult. While, we worked tirelessly, we unfortunately could not complete in time to meet deadline.

*(Fast Fourier Transform) an algorithm that computes transformations or sequences.

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS?

•Learned about a new SDK.

•Acquired knowledge about the in/outs of Android Studio.

•Most importantly as a team we learned, to rapidly adapt with change. We also learned that some ideas can sometimes fall apart. Hackthons are meant to expand your thinking outside the box in a limited amount of time. We defintely grew from this experience.
